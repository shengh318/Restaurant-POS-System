# Restaurant-POS-System
Self Made Fully Functioning Restaurant POS System

The menu of this POS system is made based off a Chinese Restaurant Menu

Everything functions jsut like how a normal register would behave. However, if you were to type in the phone number of a customer who have already ordered at this restaurant, it will recognise that and pull up the latest data about that customer so that whoever is waiting for that customer does not have to retype everthing again.

Having been a waiter for a chinese restaurant, my observation is that people who come in multiple times usually order the same exact thing and thus why I created this feature.
